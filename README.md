# Code Sinppets

The Code Snippet repository consists of code blocks that I collected or searched from the internet while finding solutions for my problems, watching tutorials, and reading tech articles. 🌺

The file should include the following comment (e.g. python file):
```py
# Description: Sort the array
# Source: happy.com
# Date: 21/01/2021  
```

Please feel free to use my code snippets or contribute your awesome code blocks. 🪐
